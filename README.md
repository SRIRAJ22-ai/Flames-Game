# 🔥 FLAMES Game

A fun and nostalgic Python script that predicts the relationship between two people based on their names using the classic **FLAMES** logic. Whether you're curious about friendship, love, or rivalry, this game gives you a playful result based on character elimination and modular arithmetic.

## 💡 What is FLAMES?

FLAMES stands for:
- **F** – Friends
- **L** – Love
- **A** – Affection
- **M** – Marriage
- **E** – Enemies
- **S** – Siblings

The game compares two names, removes common characters, and uses the remaining count to determine the relationship.
